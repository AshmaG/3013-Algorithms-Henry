Description:
This program creates a graph structure with cities as Vertices and no Edges initially.
It then connects the cities by adding edges between cities that are close together. 
It also ensures that city is reachable by ensuring that each vertex 
has a max degree of 3, where each edge represents one of three closest cities to that vertex.
